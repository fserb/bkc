In 2001, I learned about [Processing](https://processing.org/) and was amazed by
this new community of creative coders and generative programs. Shortly after,
[Jared Tarbell](https://www.infinite.center/) blew my mind with
[Substrate](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/substrate/).

I remember seeing the substrate algorithm running and being overwhelmed by the
movement and complexity of it. I couldn't understand the code. I couldn't come
to terms with a small piece of code generating so much information. When I
started[Better Know Canvas](https://canvas.rocks), I knew I had to revisit
Substrate and write about it. So here it is. Let's write substrate again.
