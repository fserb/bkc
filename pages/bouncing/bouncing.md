title: Bouncing Crystal
layout: article
draft: true
---

This crystal effect with particles is inspired by the
[bouncing demo](https://github.com/faiface/pixel-examples/tree/master/community/bouncing)
of [Go's pixel library](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) and it's interesting
because it piles up a few simple techniques together into a nice effect.

The mechanics of this effect are based on bouncing balls. The trick is that we
are going to calculate the physics of bouncing balls (technically, circles),
but we are not going to render them as such. Instead, we are going to use their
positions to render our bouncing crystal.

Apart from the boundary collision, we are also going to have a circle/circle
collision that will be simplified for two objects with the same mass. Finally,
we will have a particle system.

The colors will be out of a palette of 12 colors that will rotate around. This
allows to match colors two-by-two instead of having a fully consistent
palette.


#### Boilerplate

We start by importing our common library that includes some things like
`Math.TAU`, `Math.SQRT3`, `Math.clamp()`, in-place array filter and a
convenience `rgba()` function to generate color strings. You can check the
commented
[source code](https://github.com/fserb/bkc/blob/master/pages/extend.js), but
the functions should be fairly obvious.

```op:,spawn:2
const {rgba} = await import("{{baseURL}}extend.js");
```

We will do our [usual boilerplate](fire), where we assume there's a `canvas`
variable pointing to a valid canvas and initialize it to `1080p`.

```op:+,label:raf+1

const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
const W = canvas.width = 1920;
const H = canvas.height = 1080;

function frame(ts) {
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
frame(0);
```

We are going to set up our `requestAnimationFrame` with an `update` and a
`render` function. The first one will also receive the time elapsed and total
time. The second is supposed to not change any state. Also, remember that
`requestAnimationFrame` returns the time in milliseconds.

```op:raf+4:4
let last = 0;
function frame(ts) {
  ts /= 1000;
  const dt = (ts - last);
  last = ts;

  update(dt, ts);
  render();

  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
frame(0);
```

Finally, we just need to define our two main loop functions. They are going to
be a bit empty for now.

```op:raf+3,label:update+1+2:render+4+2

function update(dt, t) {
}

function render() {
}
```

### bouncing balls

We start by defining the crystal object with our list of control points. We are
going to have 2 control points, that we will initialize right here.

```op:raf+3,label:crystal+1,lens:this

const crystal = {
  control: [],
};

for (let i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
  crystal.control.push({
  });
}
```

Each of our control points will start with a velocity. Because we have a
physical system that will conserve energy, this will end up defining how fast
the system will be, as no new energy will be introduced. We force the initial
velocity to be within $[600,1000]$ in any direction.

```op:crystal+5
  const speed = 600 + 400 * Math.random();
  const vdir = Math.TAU * Math.random();
```
We put the control in a random position inside our canvas and create the `vel`
vector to match the generated `speed` and `vdir`.

```op:crystal+8
    pos: {x: W * Math.random(), y: H * Math.random()},
    vel: {x: speed * Math.cos(vdir), y: speed * Math.sin(vdir)},
```

We also define a `radius` (since they are circles) and an internal state to
track whether they have bounced at something this frame.

```op:crystal+10
    radius: 64,
    bounced: false,
```

For now, we will render them as circles, so we can have some idea of what's
happening (you can press on âŸ³ to restart with different values).

```op:render:,lens:crystal+render
function render() {
  ctx.reset();
  ctx.fillStyle = "#222";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, W, H);
  for (const c of crystal.control) {
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#F00';
    ctx.fillStyle = '#700';
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(c.pos.x, c.pos.y, c.radius, 0, Math.TAU);
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.stroke();
  }
}
```

```op:+,lens:crystal+render
```

Cool. Now let's do some movement. The first thing to do is update the position
given the velocity. Since we have no acceleration, the proper integration is
trivial.

```op:update+1,lens:update
  for (const c of crystal.control) {
    c.pos.x += c.vel.x * dt;
    c.pos.y += c.vel.y * dt;
  }
```

We should make sure that our balls actually bounce on the borders. For this, we
can create a generic function that bounce any circle inside the screen area.
This will be useful for us to reuse it later on the particles.

```op:update-1,label:bounce+1,lens:bounce+update

function bounce(obj) {
}
```

For each dimension, we check if the circle is touching each side of the screen,
and if it is, we move it in and invert the velocity.

```op:bounce+1,lens:bounce+update
  if (obj.pos.x <= obj.radius || obj.pos.x >= W - obj.radius) {
    obj.vel.x = -obj.vel.x;
    obj.pos.x = Math.clamp(obj.pos.x, obj.radius, W - obj.radius);
  }
```

We do this for both dimensions and we also want to return whether we have
touched the side or not, as this will be useful for us later.

```op:bounce:
function bounce(obj) {
  let bounced = false;
  if (obj.pos.x <= obj.radius || obj.pos.x >= W - obj.radius) {
    obj.vel.x = -obj.vel.x;
    bounced = true;
    obj.pos.x = Math.clamp(obj.pos.x, obj.radius, W - obj.radius);
  }
  if (obj.pos.y <= obj.radius || obj.pos.y >= H - obj.radius) {
    obj.vel.y = -obj.vel.y;
    bounced = true;
    obj.pos.y = Math.clamp(obj.pos.y, obj.radius, H - obj.radius);
  }
  return bounced;
}
```

Finally, we just need to use our new `bounce()` function on update, propagating
the result value into the control object.

```op:update+4,lens:bounce+update
    if (bounce(c)) {
      c.bounced = true;
    }
```

@[canvas-demo]
```op:+
```

Next we need to deal with the collision between them.

```op:update-1

function updateCollision(a, b) {

}
```
```op:update+8
  updateCollision(crystal.control[0], crystal.control[1]);
```
